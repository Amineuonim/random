so this is the script i use to detect dark dots using open cv , the main reason why i am doing this is so that i can have boiler plate code to use later in case i need it in the future.
the idea behind using this is to do a facial mocap on my low end pc , the idea was to approach this in the more traditional way by drawing dots on what you want to capture in a relatively bright background then you can use th coordinates to manipulate the mesh like you want.
some usefull links i used are :
  learn opencv documentation : https://learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/
  this repository which is what i was aiming for: https://github.com/jkirsons/FacialMotionCapture_v2
